### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Coley Dohmen. I am currently a student at Codeworks out of Boise, ID. I was recently introduced into the world of coding and very quickly fell in love with it, you really can't beat that rush you get when you are stuck on a coding issue and you finally figure it out and everything runs smoothly again! When I'm not working on code, I can be found spending time with my family or gaming with friends. I love to laugh and am great with communicating with those around me. I am looking forward to the future and seeing where my love for coding takes me.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning -  HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, MongoDB, Vue 3, MVC Patterns, APIs, C#

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Email: coley.dawn12@gmail.com, LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/coley-dohmen/

- âš¡ Fun fact: My favorite number is 8. I have lived in six states, one of them being Hawaii. My favorite color is blue, obviously because it's the best color out there.
