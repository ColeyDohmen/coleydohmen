Thanks for taking the time to interview me today, I am excited to be here! 
I am a full-stack software developer and I recently graduated from a software development bootcamp. I learned many languages through the bootcamp,
Vue, C#, Javascript, & Node.js just to name a few. I learned how to build full-stack applications and how to utilize SCRUM.
Before that, I was a school/sports photographer for the best voted photography studio in NorCal, I was a teacher's assistant for a 
kindergarten class, and I was a truck broker for nursery stock all around the country! 
While I loved all of my previous jobs, none of them quite clicked with me the way software development does.
I'm very logically and mathematically driven and coding is very in line with me in that aspect. I absolutely love the challenges I face
on a daily basis, it's something super exciting for me and I am looking forward to seeing where the developing world takes me.
